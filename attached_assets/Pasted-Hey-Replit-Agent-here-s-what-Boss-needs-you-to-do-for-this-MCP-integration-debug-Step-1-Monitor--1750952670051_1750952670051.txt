Hey Replit Agent - here's what Boss needs you to do for this MCP integration debug:
Step 1: Monitor Server Logs During ElevenLabs Connection
Add logging middleware to see what ElevenLabs is requesting:
In your server/mcp.ts file, add this logging code RIGHT AT THE TOP of your MCP route handlers:
typescript// Add this logging middleware before any MCP endpoints
app.use('/api/mcp*', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('\n=== ELEVENLABS MCP REQUEST ===');
  console.log('Timestamp:', new Date().toISOString());
  console.log('Method:', req.method);
  console.log('URL:', req.url);
  console.log('Headers:', JSON.stringify(req.headers, null, 2));
  console.log('Body:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
  console.log('Query:', JSON.stringify(req.query, null, 2));
  console.log('===============================\n');
  next();
});
Step 2: Check Your Current SSE Endpoint Implementation
Find and show me your current /api/mcp GET endpoint code. Look for:

How it handles SSE connections
What it sends when ElevenLabs connects
If it responds to MCP protocol initialize requests
The exact format of responses

Step 3: Test and Report Results

Deploy the logging changes
Watch the console output
In ElevenLabs, click "Test Connection"
Copy ALL the log output that appears in console
Report back the exact logs - don't summarize, give me everything

Step 4: Check Your Current MCP Protocol Handler
Show me the code that handles these MCP requests:

initialize method calls
tools/list method calls
How your server responds to JSON-RPC requests

What I Need You to Report Back:

The exact log output when ElevenLabs tries to connect
Your current SSE endpoint code (the /api/mcp GET handler)
Any error messages in the Replit console
The current MCP protocol implementation - how you handle initialize/tools requests

The goal: Figure out exactly what format ElevenLabs is expecting vs what your server is sending, so we can fix the HTTP 500 "Failed to extract MCP server tools" error.
Do this step by step and report back the actual results - don't just say "it's working" or "it failed" - give me the specific logs and code.
