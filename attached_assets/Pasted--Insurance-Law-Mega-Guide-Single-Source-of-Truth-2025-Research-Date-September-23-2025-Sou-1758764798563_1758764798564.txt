This section provides a Florida‐style template for converting course content from Florida to other states and a detailed statute map for 28 states (Alaska through South Dakota).  For each state it lists the statutory provisions governing producer licensing, unfair/market practices, guaranty associations, policy form and rate filings, adjuster licensing, appointments, and continuing education (CE) requirements.  Where available the exact code sections are provided alongside backlinks to state regulatory or legislative pages so that the information can be self‑audited.  The CE hours included here represent typical producer requirements for standard lines of authority; some lines (such as long‑term care, annuity suitability or flood) may require additional courses—always consult the linked regulator pages for the most current rules.

Florida template

When converting Florida insurance coursework to another state, replace references to Florida’s statutes and agencies with the corresponding state provisions.  Florida uses the Department of Financial Services (DFS) and Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) under an elected Chief Financial Officer.  Core Florida sections include: §626.112 (license required), Chapter 626 (producer licensing), §626.9541 (unfair methods of competition), Chapter 631 (insurance guaranty associations) and §§627.062/627.410 (rate and form approval) ￼.  Florida producer CE requires 24 hours every two years, including 5 hours of law and ethics.  The table below maps these categories to equivalent statutes in each state.

Statute map by state

For each state the key statutes and CE requirements are summarised.  The License Required / Definitions entry points to the section requiring producers to hold a license and defining basic terms; Producer Licensing covers the rules for issuing and renewing producer licenses; Unfair Practices lists the chapter prohibiting rebating, twisting/churning and other unfair marketing practices; Guaranty Associations identifies the sections creating property/casualty and life/health guaranty funds; Forms & Rates refers to the authority approving policy forms and rates; Adjusters notes special provisions for adjuster licensing; Appointments covers requirements for insurer appointments; and CE Requirement states the typical hours and cycle for continuing education.  Sources cite the official regulator or legislative pages used in the research.  Where CE information is not codified, it comes from the state’s licensing or continuing‑education FAQ page.
