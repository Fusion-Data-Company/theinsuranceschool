# ElevenLabs MCP Server Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to integrate the Insurance School Recruiting MCP server with ElevenLabs voice agents. The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server allows voice agents to query real-time analytics data during calls, enabling agents to answer questions like "How many enrollments did we have today?" or "What's our conversion rate?"

## Server Configuration

### MCP Endpoint Details
- **URL**: `https://your-replit-url.replit.app/api/mcp`
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: Bearer Token
- **Response Format**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Secret Token**: `recruiting-mcp-secret-2024`

### Health Check
- **URL**: `https://your-replit-url.replit.app/api/mcp/health`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: `{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}`

## Available Query Types

### Daily Metrics
- `enrollments_today` - Count of new enrollments today
- `leads_today` - Count of new leads captured today
- `revenue_today` - Total completed payments today

### Lead Analytics
- `qualified_leads` - Count of leads ready for enrollment
- `conversion_rate` - Current lead-to-enrollment conversion rate
- `recent_activity` - Latest 5 lead activities

### Business Intelligence
- `enrollment_breakdown` - Breakdown by course type
- `license_types` - Distribution of license goals (2-15, 2-40, 2-14)
- `call_summary` - Today's call statistics with interest levels

### Performance Metrics
- `agent_performance` - Average AI agent confidence score
- `lead:ID` - Specific lead details (replace ID with actual lead ID)

## ElevenLabs Configuration

### Step 1: Register MCP Server
1. Go to ElevenLabs Dashboard > Custom MCP Servers
2. Click "Add New MCP Server"
3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Name**: Insurance School Analytics
   - **Type**: SSE (Server-Sent Events)
   - **URL**: `https://your-replit-url.replit.app/api/mcp`
   - **Authentication**: Bearer Token
   - **Token**: `recruiting-mcp-secret-2024`

### Step 2: Configure Headers
Add the following header:
```
Authorization: Bearer recruiting-mcp-secret-2024
```

### Step 3: Test the Connection
Use the test feature in ElevenLabs to verify the connection with a sample query:
```json
{"query": "enrollments_today"}
```

Expected response:
```
data: {"result": "X new enrollments today"}
```

## Sample Voice Agent Prompts

### Analytics Questions Agent Can Answer
```
- "How many people enrolled today?"
- "What's our conversion rate this week?"
- "How many qualified leads do we have?"
- "What types of licenses are people most interested in?"
- "Can you tell me about lead number 123?"
- "How much revenue did we make today?"
- "How are our agents performing?"
```

### Example Agent Script
```
When a caller asks about business metrics, I can access real-time data:

User: "How many students enrolled today?"
Agent: [Queries MCP with "enrollments_today"]
Agent: "We've had 14 new enrollments today! Would you like to join them?"

User: "What's your conversion rate?"
Agent: [Queries MCP with "conversion_rate"]
Agent: "Our current conversion rate is 25%, which means 1 in 4 people who speak with us decide to enroll. We'd love to help you become part of that success!"
```

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
Store the MCP secret token securely:
```bash
# In your Replit environment
MCP_SECRET_TOKEN=recruiting-mcp-secret-2024
```

### Access Control
- Only authenticated requests with valid Bearer tokens are accepted
- All requests are logged for monitoring
- Rate limiting can be implemented if needed

## Database Schema Support

The MCP server has access to the following data:

### Core Tables
- **Leads**: Contact info, license goals, status, source
- **Enrollments**: Course assignments, cohorts, progress
- **Call Records**: Transcripts, sentiment, agent confidence
- **Payments**: Transaction amounts, payment plans, status
- **Agent Metrics**: Performance scores, response times

### Relationships
- One-to-many: Leads â†’ Call Records, Payments, Enrollments
- Analytics are calculated in real-time from live data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 401 Unauthorized
- Check that the Bearer token is correctly configured
- Verify the token matches the server configuration

#### Connection Timeouts
- Ensure the Replit app is running and accessible
- Check the URL format and SSL certificate

#### Empty Responses
- Verify the query string is correctly formatted
- Check server logs for any database connection issues

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by checking the Replit console for MCP requests:
```
1:00:17 AM [express] POST /api/mcp 200 in 243ms
```

## Performance Metrics

### Response Times
- Simple queries (count operations): ~50-100ms
- Complex analytics: ~100-250ms
- Lead lookups: ~60-80ms

### Scalability
- Current implementation handles concurrent requests
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Can scale with Replit's infrastructure

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: Use Replit's deployment feature
2. **Custom Domain**: Configure a custom domain for production
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Add more complex business intelligence queries
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for failed requests or performance issues

## Support

For technical issues:
- Check Replit console logs
- Test endpoints using the MCP Demo page at `/mcp-demo`
- Verify database connectivity with health check endpoint

This integration enables real-time business intelligence during voice calls, providing agents with immediate access to current enrollment numbers, conversion rates, and lead information to enhance sales conversations.
